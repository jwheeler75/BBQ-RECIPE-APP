## Code Snippet

This code allows you create multiline form input.  In this application, I'm also prepopulating the input boxes with a value from the db.

<form action="/recipes/<%=recipe.id%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
    Type of Meat:<br />
    <textarea rows="1" cols="8"><%=recipe.typeOfMeat%></textarea>
    <br />
    Recipe:<br />
    <textarea name="recipeName" rows="1" cols="40"><%=recipe.recipeName%></textarea>
    <br />
    Ingredients:<br />
    <textarea name="ingredients" rows="10" cols="50"><%=recipe.ingredients%></textarea>
    <br />
    Instructions:<br />
    <textarea name="instructions" rows="40" cols="50"><%=recipe.instructions%></textarea>
    <br />
    <input type="submit" name="" value="Submit Changes" />
  </form>

## Issues and Resolutions

**ERROR**: Unwanted spacing in the textarea boxes causing issues with hardcoded drop box options.                               
**RESOLUTION**: Using the prettier extention in VS Code moved the input value to the next line, and I indented it to make it flow with the rest of the code.  This added the unwanted spaces when it was rendered.
